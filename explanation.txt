Portfolio Extraction Code Structure a
=====================================

1. main.py
----------
Purpose: Entry point of the application
- Contains list of all supported AMC names
- Creates directories for each AMC
- Matches AMC names to appropriate parsers
- Processes portfolio files and saves output

2. core/FundPortfolioParser.py
-----------------------------
Purpose: Abstract base class for all parsers
- Defines the core parsing structure and workflow
- Handles Excel file reading (xls, xlsx, xlsb formats)
- Manages sheet processing and data combination
- Provides error handling framework

3. portfolio/parser.py
---------------------
Purpose: Contains all AMC-specific parser implementations
- Each parser class (HDFCParser, ICICIParser, etc.) inherits from FundPortfolioParser
- Implements AMC-specific sheet reading and cleaning methods
- Manages index sheet reading for fund name mapping
- Connected by: main.py uses these parsers
- Connects to: 
  * core/FundPortfolioParser.py (inherits from)
  * portfolio/eparse.py (uses cleaning functions)

4. portfolio/eparse.py
---------------------
Purpose: Contains detailed cleaning functions for each AMC
- Implements specific data cleaning logic for each AMC
- Handles column standardization
- Processes fund names and ISINs
- Converts market values
- Manages data type conversions

5. portfolio/utils.py
--------------------
Purpose: Utility functions used across the project
- Common helper functions
- Data validation utilities
- Shared formatting functions

6. portfolio/eparse_legacy/
--------------------------
Purpose: Directory containing legacy parsing scripts
- Individual parsing scripts for different AMCs
- Historical implementations
- Reference for standardization


This structure ensures:
- Modular design
- Easy addition of new AMCs
- Consistent data processing
- Standardized output format
- Maintainable codebase 

Mutual Fund Portfolio Data Processing System

Performance:
- Each AMC's portfolio data is processed in less than a minute
- Efficient data extraction and standardization
- Automated fund name and ISIN validation

Currently Supported AMCs:
1. PPFAS Mutual Fund
2. HDFC Mutual Fund
3. ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund
4. Axis Mutual Fund
5. Mirae Asset Mutual Fund
6. Nippon India Mutual Fund
7. Quant Mutual Fund
8. SBI Mutual Fund
9. Kotak Mutual Fund
10. Bank of India Mutual Fund

Remaining Funds and their issues:- 
-Franklin: They publish their monthly portfolio disclosure embedded in their webpage
-Edelweiss: Do not have the record of crucial details like ISIN, Industry etc.
-Union: The data is scattered in the internet pretty inconsisently, finding it hard to get the data
